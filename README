Uber Connector
==============
Provides multiple connectors for interfacing with different data-sources in .NET (written in C#) whilst using an interface to allow data-sources to be changed whilst leaving interacting code the same. This allows for e.g. content-management-systems and other applications to use different platforms and software whilst minimizing code-changes.

Supported data-sources:
> MySQL
> SQLite
> MSSQL (untested and not recommended)
> Postgres

Possible future data-sources:
> Microsoft Jet

Features:
> Logging
> Connect/disconnect
> Change database
> Queries
-- Read
-- Execute
-- Scalar
-- Count
> Custom exceptions implemented

Third-party binaies are also included; versions:
> MySQL		6.4.4.0
> SQLite	3.7.1.1
> Npgsql	2.0.11.93

To-do:
> Add states and events.
