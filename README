Uber Connector
***********************************************************************************
About
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
A wrapper for using different data-sources in .NET (written in C#) using a single
universal standard for data-types and parent connector object. This will allow
applications to support multiple data-sources with minimal changes to the
code-base.

Supported data-sources:
> MySQL
> SQLite (partial)

Supported platforms:
> Tested on Windows (XP/2003/7/8/2008)
> Tested on Linux (Arch using Mono ~ http://www.mono-project.com)

Features:
> Logging.
> Connect/disconnect/check the connection is ready.
> Change database.
> Queries - read, execute, scalar and count.
> Custom exceptions.
> Prepared statements.
> Binary data read/write.
> SQLUtils class for escaping and other utility features.

Build Change-Log
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
For actual code-changes, review the code files separately and refer to their
header change-log.

v1.6.3.0:
-	Better handling of MySQL parameters.
-	Added more class/modifier security to ResultRow.
-	Added more support for BLOBs being read as byte arrays.
v1.6.2.0:
-	Added connector-type property and enum.
v1.6.0.1:
-	Added better support for null values.
v1.6.0.0:
-	Added prepared statements, major code clean-up, minor improvements, removed MSSQL
	(poor implementation, discontinued), comment headers updated to new standard,
	README updated to new standard, updated MySQL connector library. The code-format
	should be majorly improved, along with code documentation. Connection checking
	on every single read/execute has also been removed, as this is not needed in most
	cases and most likely just slows down processing time.
v1.5.0.0:
-	Added Query_Scalar_Parameters.
v1.4.0.0:
-	Added and implemented DuplicateEntryException for MySQL.
v1.3.0.0:
-	Added the ability to execute and read stored procedures.
v1.2.0.0:
-	Added change-log.
- 	Added connection-checking before any queries in-case of the connection being broken due to idling.
- 	CRITICAL: discovered an SQL-injection vulnerability with modifier-letter-apostrophe character; this is a unicode character
	and usually ignored (I believe)...and the MySQL escape documentation (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-literals.html)
	does not mention this character.
-	Improved escaping method.
