Uber Connector
==============
Provides multiple connectors for interfacing with different data-sources in .NET (written in C#) whilst using an interface to allow data-sources to be changed whilst leaving interacting code the same. This allows for e.g. content-management-systems and other applications to use different platforms and software whilst minimizing code-changes.

Supported data-sources:
> MySQL
> SQLite
> MSSQL (untested and not recommended)

Possible future data-sources:
> Microsoft Jet
> Postgres

Features:
> Logging
> Connect/disconnect
> Change database
> Queries
-- Read
-- Execute
-- Scalar
-- Count
> Custom exceptions implemented

Third-party binaies are also included; versions:
> MySQL		6.4.4.0
> SQLite	3.7.1.1
> Npgsql	2.0.11.93

To-do:
> Add states and events.

Issues:
> MSSQL needs testing and completing

Change-log:
v1.4.0.0:
-	Added and implemented DuplicateEntryException for MySQL.
v1.3.0.0:
-	Added the ability to execute and read stored procedures.
v1.2.0.0:
-	Added change-log.
- 	Added connection-checking before any queries in-case of the connection being broken due to idling.
- 	CRITICAL: discovered an SQL-injection vulnerability with modifier-letter-apostrophe character; this is a unicode character
	and usually ignored (I believe)...and the MySQL escape documentation (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-literals.html)
	does not mention this character.
-	Improved escaping method.
