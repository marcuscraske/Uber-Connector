Uber Connector provides multiple connectors for interfacing with different data-sources in .NET (written in C#) whilst using an interface to allow data-sources to be changed whilst leaving interacting code the same. This allows for e.g. content-management-systems and other applications to use different platforms and software whilst minimizing code-changes.
